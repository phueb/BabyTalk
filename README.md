A Flask-based micro-service which returns completions of a user's phrase generated by a recurrent network trained to predict 5M words of child-directed speech.

A demo can be found [here](http://philhuebner.com/projects/baby-talk.html).


### Hosting on Hostgator.com

On your remote host, in `public_html`:

```bash
mkdir babytalk
cd babytalk
git init
git config --add receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore
```

Next, add add `GIT_WORK_TREE=../ git checkout -f` to `.git/hooks/post-receive` 

Then, 

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receive
```

To install `flask`:
```bash
virtualenv --never-download -p python2.6 /home2/huebner3/www/babytalk/venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
deactivate
```

Finally, make sure `__init__.py` is in `src` and make `app.fcgi` executable::
```bash
chmod +x app.fcgi
```

To push changes to hostgator, first add `ssh://USERNAME@HOST:2222/home2/USERNAME/public_html/babytalk`
to your local repository.

Note: To avoid Cross-Origin resource errors when requesting a response from another domain, add `Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"` to `.htaccess`.
